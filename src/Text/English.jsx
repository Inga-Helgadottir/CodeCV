    "I am an educated Full-Stack developer (back-end and front-end developer) who loves coding. I am a nerd at heart with a passion for coding and learning new things and I know when you work with code, you will never run out of new things to learn. My main goal when coding is to make it easy for the user to understand without having to read any documentation to understand how to use the application. I also like to make my code easy to update in the future, when new features need to be added or when new and better technologies become available. ",
    "I prefer to think through the functionality before I start coding, so I get the best and cleanest code for the purpose. I like working with Agile methodologies, where everything is planned, and I even like getting a surprise new feature in the middle of a project. I love thinking through how to make my code as easy to update as possible, as all technology keeps growing, getting safer and easier to use, which means all code will eventually be changed.",
    "I am an honest, kind, and creative person, who is good at being impartial and fair. I work well both independently and as a part of a group. I have had a lot of practice explaining code related things to people who know nothing about code or even computers in general.",
    "I have always been good at memorization; I have even memorized a deck of cards in the span of two days. Some numbers even get stuck for life, like this number 0118 999 88199 9119 725 3 from a TV show called “The IT crowd” ask me about it in an interview.",
    "Outside of coding I enjoy hanging out with friends, painting, baking, and playing board, card and computer games. I also like to take pictures, here are some I took during a school trip to Jordan",

Even though they don’t have enough coding projects to give me a job, they did have a few possible projects, one of which was making a very large CSV file easier to search through, as searching through the existing file was confusing and time consuming. I built the user interface for this data in ReactJS, I used Python to alter multiple different filetypes to pdfs files. I also used Python to join some Excel files together based on a few shared columns.",

      "Shortly after my internship ended, I was contacted by Furesø kommune for a temporary position helping their RPA developer (Robotic process automation). For the first 4 weeks I got a crash course in Power automate and some of the more important robots. By the second week I had gotten the hang of building and updating Power automate robots. The rest of the time I was taught about their most important robots, at the end of those 4 weeks their RPA developer quit, so I was on my own maintaining their many robots for months. I worked a lot in Power automate and regularly used HTML and CSS to format emails and Python scripts for the more advanced functions, that can be difficult to complete in Power automate alone.",

Inga maintained and developed RPA solutions in the finance department. Inga had limited experience with RPA when she started, but learned very quickly to solve the tasks with the daily operation and development of new solutions in Power Automate. Inga was responsible for her tasks, good to work with and she also enjoyed participating in the department's social life. If you have Inga in mind for a job, please get in touch.",

We worked on updating one of their websites called VejVejr as the old version had become outdated. This new version was a Single Page Application created with ReactJS and multiple frameworks and component libraries and as a code hosting platform, we used GitLab. We added functionality for monitoring user defined alarms and choosing how you are notified, either on the site, via SMS and/or email. For example, you could get notified if there is frost at a particular weather station, so you know when to salt the roads near that station.",
      "We continued working for DMI through our main project as well, on the same site but a different tab. This time we worked on a tab that shows a map of all the weather stations in Denmark. There we used modern visualization tools to add two new parameters crosswind and wind gust to the map, showing the strength of the crosswind and wind gust, along with a graph over the readings from the last few hours at this station.",

Each team was given a decade, and we got the 40’s. We all worked as a team to make a website dedicated to our decade, I worked closely with the UX/UI designer to make our website which sadly is no longer online.
